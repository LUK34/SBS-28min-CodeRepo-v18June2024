1.  Create a folder called `example-files`.
2. Create a file called `Request.xml` (Right click file ->give name of the file and extension).

3. What is xsd??
 	3.1) XSD, or XML Schema Definition, is a language used to define the structure, content, and semantics of XML documents. 
		Within the context of SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), which is a protocol used for exchanging structured information in web services, 
		XSD plays a crucial role in defining the format and data types of the SOAP messages.

4. what are the key Points about XSD in SOAP:
		4.1) Structure Definition: XSD is used to formally describe the elements, attributes, and data types that can appear in a SOAP message. 
		It ensures that the data adheres to a predefined structure, which is essential for the consuming applications to correctly interpret the data.
		4.2) Data Type Enforcement: XSD allows for precise specification of data types within XML files.
		 It supports a wide range of built-in data types such as integers, strings, dates, and complex structures. 
		 This helps in validating the data that forms part of SOAP requests and responses.
		4.3) Validation: By using an XSD, SOAP messages can be validated for correctness before they are processed by the web service.
		 This reduces errors and improves the robustness of web service interactions.
		4.4) Interoperability: Since XSD provides a standard way to describe the structure of XML data,
		 it enhances interoperability between different systems and platforms that use SOAP web services. 
		 Systems can rely on the XSD to correctly parse and use the data exchanged via SOAP messages.
		4.5) WSDL Integration: In SOAP web services, the Web Services Description Language (WSDL) is often used to describe the network services offered.
		 WSDL itself incorporates XSD to define the data types and structures of the SOAP messages exchanged in web service operations.
		4.6) XSD is fundamental in SOAP-based web services as it provides a means to define and validate the structure and data of the messages, 
		ensuring that both the sender and receiver have a mutual understanding of the format and types of data being exchanged.

		
5. what is xsi??
	5.1)In the context of SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), which is used for exchanging structured information in web services communication,
	 xsi refers to the XML Schema instance namespace. This namespace is commonly used to include data type declarations in XML documents, 
	 which is crucial for defining how elements are interpreted and validated against an XML Schema.


6. what are the key Points about xsi in SOAP:
	6.1) Namespace URI: 
	The xsi prefix is associated with the namespace URI http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance. 
	This is a standard namespace used across many XML-based technologies, including SOAP.
	6.2) Purpose: The primary purpose of including the xsi namespace in a SOAP message (or any XML document) is to specify schema location 
	and to assert type information. Attributes defined in the XML Schema instance namespace, such as xsi:type, xsi:nil, xsi:schemaLocation, 
	and xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation, are used for these purposes.
	6.3) xsi:type: This is perhaps the most frequently used xsi attribute. It allows the XML document to explicitly specify the data type of an element 
	as defined in an XML Schema. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the element's type needs to be defined dynamically, or where the type
	 might differ from what is expected in the schema.
	6.4) xsi:nil: Another important attribute, xsi:nil, is used to indicate that an element has no value. 
	This is useful for representing null values in XML, where merely omitting an element can be ambiguous.
	6.5) Usage in SOAP: In SOAP messages, which are based on XML, these attributes are used to ensure that the data types of the elements
	 are clear and conform to the expected schema. This helps in validating the SOAP message against its definition, ensuring both syntactic and 
	 schematic correctness.


 7. Whatever contents are present in the xsd file will be present in wsdl file.
 wsdl file specified the contents that are present in schema.
 
 8. The contents are as follows:
 	
 	8.1)  `<wsdl:types>`
 	The <wsdl:types> element is a container for data type definitions that are used by the web service. 
 	These data type definitions are usually specified in XML Schema (XSD) format.
 	 The <wsdl:types> element allows you to define complex data types that the web service can use for input and output messages.
 
 	8.2) `<wsdl:message>`
 	The <wsdl:message> element defines the data being exchanged between the web service and the client. It basically defines the request and response.
 	Each message consists of one or more parts, which can be simple or complex data types defined in the <wsdl:types> section.
 	
 	8.3) `<wsdl:portType>`
 	The <wsdl:portType> element defines a collection of operations (methods) that the web service exposes. 
 	Each operation corresponds to a specific action that the service can perform, and it specifies the input and output messages involved in the operation
 	
 	8.4) `<wsdl:binding>`
 	The <wsdl:binding> element specifies the concrete protocol and data format specifications for the operations and messages defined in the <wsdl:portType>.
 	 It tells how the service is bound to a specific protocol (e.g., SOAP over HTTP).
 	
 	8.5) `<wsdl:service>`
 	The <wsdl:service> element defines the endpoint (address) for the web service. It specifies where the service can be accessed.
 	
 9.
 When we are going to use a Queue to transfer the requests and response. The style we are using here is document
to indicate the fact that we are actually exchanging complete XML requests and XML response. The alternative for a document is actually something called RPC, which is remote procedure calls.
It’s like calling a procedure which is defined somewhere else. It’s like calling a Java method which is present somewhere else. When we use a RPC, we would need to define
the input parameters and we would need to define the return type. Just like a method. Document is the most frequently used style of SOAP binding.
